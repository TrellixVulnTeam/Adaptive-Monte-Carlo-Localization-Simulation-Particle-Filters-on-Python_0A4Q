The noise parameters are turn , forward move, and sensing noise. 
The robot measures 4 landmarks distance represented by big blue dot. 
The green circle is the robot actual pose, and the blue circle is the most significant particle by the weighing
and the bubbles are the particles. 
The estimation error gets smaller along with the robot movement. 
Probably, how the significant particle selected it's not optimal, well if anyone knows how to get it better, just let me know. Finally, this project is quite challenging and fun.
